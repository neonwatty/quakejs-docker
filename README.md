# A https friendly docker image for quakejs

This repo contains a Dockerfile and associated files to conveniently package [quakejs](https://github.com/begleysm/quakejs) in for https-friendly deployment. A pre-built image for both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 can be [found here](https://github.com/users/neonwatty/packages/container/package/quakejs-https).

This image is used as the base for a [convenient https deployment strategy using kamal 2](https://github.com/neonwatty/kamal-quake).

It was inspired by this great http-friendly [docker pattern](https://github.com/treyyoder/quakejs-docker).
